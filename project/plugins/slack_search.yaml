 This plugin retrieves relevant messages from Slack.
  Before answering a question, use SlackSearcher defined in the slack skill to retrieve relevant answers from Slack.  
  Before calling the slack_search function, first convert the question to a small slack query string that will have the
  highest likelihood of matching messages that could help answer the question. Use the matching messages
  to inform the answer to the original query.

  # the original query: "How do you set up the performance testing environment?"
  query_results = slack_search("performance testing")
