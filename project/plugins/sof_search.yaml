 This plugin retrieves relevant questions and answers from StackOverflow for Teams.
  The sof_search function only matches exact strings in the question titles,
  so pick out the three most critical words in the question and search for those individual keywords separately.  Then
  use the result of those three searches to inform the answer to the original query.
examples: |-
  # the original query: "How do you set up the performance testing environment?"
  query_results = sof_search("performance")
  query_results = sof_search("testing")

parameters:
  - name: query
    type: str
    required: true
    description: >-
      The query is a well-formed sentence that describes the user's information need.

returns:
  - name: results
    type: str
    description: list of search results in JSON format
